//! English is the source language: every string in the app is written in English, and `tr()` looks each up
//! in the table below when the app is set to Chinese. A string that is not in the table stays English, so a
//! missing line is never a bug.
//!
//! Three things need translating, and each has its own way in:
//! - a fixed label or sentence: `tr("Settings")`
//! - a sentence with values in it: the `tf!` macro, `tf!("Loading {}…", "正在加载 {}…", name)`
//! - a line built elsewhere as a `String` (a reply's status, a tool's name): `status()` and `label()`,
//!   which take the English line apart.
