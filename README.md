  <b>Fast local LLM inference for the GPU you already have.</b><br>
  One small Rust program that runs GGUF models on an NVIDIA card, serves an OpenAI-compatible API,<br>
  and comes with a desktop app where the model works on your files.

  <br><sub>Real time, not sped up: the desktop app fixing a failing test, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B (Huihui abliterated, i1-Q3_K_M) on an RTX 2060 SUPER (8 GB) with 16 GB of RAM.</sub>

Most inference engines are built for data centres: many users, big GPUs, batching. ghost-infer is built
for the other case: **one person, one consumer GPU, one model at a time**, and it is tuned for exactly that.

## Install

**[Download GhostSetup for Windows](https://github.com/affifuddin-hazam/ghost-infer/releases/latest)** and run
it. It needs no administrator rights and nothing else installed. The app starts the server and, the first
time, offers models to download, or uses the GGUF files you already have.

<details>
<summary>Build from source</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/affifuddin-hazam/ghost-infer
cd ghost-infer
cargo build --release
target\release\ghost-infer serve models\Qwen3-8B-Q4_K_M.gguf --gpu
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8080> to chat, or point any OpenAI client at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`. Built from
source, it needs the CUDA toolkit's NVRTC: see [Building](docs/building.md).

## Speed

On an 8 GB RTX 2060 SUPER with 16 GB of RAM, on the same GGUF files:

| Generation speed | ghost-infer | llama.cpp | Ollama |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3 8B, 5 GB: fits in the GPU | **70.3 tokens/s** | 64.8 | 66.0 |
| Qwen3-30B-A3B, 13.7 GB: bigger than the GPU | **38.0 tokens/s** | 23.7 | 21.7 |
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B, 14.7 GB \* | **32.7 / 47.3** | not measured | not measured |
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B, 16.8 GB \* | **31.9 / 31.9** | 26.0 / 24.9 | not measured |
| Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B, 22 GB: bigger than the RAM \* | **11.8 / 14.5** | 9.3 / 12.4 | not measured |

<sub>llama.cpp b11747 and Ollama 0.40.13. The first two rows: GuideLLM and seven varied prompts, llama.cpp at
its best `--n-cpu-moe` setting. Rows marked \*: tokens/s writing code / writing a long answer, the second (warm)
of two runs, llama.cpp with its automatic GPU split. Method and more results in [Benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md).</sub>

## What you get

- **One small program.** About 3 MB with two Rust dependencies: no Python, no Docker. It compiles its GPU
  code for your card on first start.
- **Models bigger than your GPU.** Mixture-of-experts models keep their experts in RAM and the ones a reply
  is using in VRAM, and an 80B model runs on an 8 GB card.
- **A desktop app with an agent.** The model reads and edits your files and runs commands, asking first,
  with permission modes, a task list and background jobs. [More](docs/desktop-app.md)
- **Drop-in server.** OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` with streaming and tool calls, so editor
  plugins, chat apps and agent harnesses work unchanged. [More](docs/usage.md)
- **Exact where it matters.** Speculative decoding gives the same output as plain greedy decoding, and
  results are checked against exact maths and llama.cpp. [More](docs/how-it-works.md)

## Models

The app offers these on its first start:

| Model | Download | Good for |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.6-35B-A3B | 16.8 GB | Thinks before it answers: coding and agent work (16 GB of RAM) |
| Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B | 14.7 GB | Answers at once: fast for code |
| Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 | 2.5 GB | Computers with less memory |

Other GGUF files of Llama, Qwen3, Qwen3-Next, Qwen3.5 / 3.6 and DeepSeek-style models such as
GLM-4.7-Flash run too, in Q3_K to Q8_0 or the 2-bit IQ2 formats: [the full list](docs/building.md#supported-models).

## Requirements

Windows 10 or 11, an NVIDIA GPU from the GTX 10 series on with a current driver, and a CPU with AVX2.

## Documentation

- [Benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md): the method, long contexts, mixture of experts, speculative decoding
- [The desktop app and the chat page](docs/desktop-app.md)
- [Command line and server API](docs/usage.md)
- [How it works](docs/how-it-works.md), and its accuracy
- [Building, requirements and models](docs/building.md): from source, GPU requirements, the installer

## Roadmap

- Linux support
- More architectures (Gemma, Llama 3 tokenizer) and formats (Q4_0, the other IQ quants)
- Constrained decoding for tool calls
